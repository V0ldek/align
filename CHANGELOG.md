## [0.0.3] - 2022-05-18


### Bug Fixes

#### Impl of `Default` returning unaligned ptrs.
- Implementations of `Default` for
-  `AlignedBytes`
-  `&AlignedSlice`
-  `&mut AlignedSlice`
- were incorrect by using `NonNull::dangling` as the pointer.
- That pointer need not be aligned to the specified `Alignment`.
- This was fixed by using std's `dangling` implementation tweaked to
- the required alignment, while still not allocating.

### Reliability

#### Allow miri symbolic-alignment-check.
- Miri's `-Zmiri-symbolic-alignment-check` breaks `align_offset` to always return `usize::MAX` (that is by design), so we need to fallback to regular cast-then-modulo alignment check for tests when running under Miri.

## [0.0.1] - 2022-05-17

### Features

#### Initial API.
-  Alignment types driven by the `alignment` module.
-  `AlignedBytes` -- aligned container
-  `AlignedSlice` -- type guarantee on alignment of `&[u8]`
-  `AlignedBlockIterator` -- iterate aligned blocks of a slice.
-  Quality of life implementations of `Deref` and `std::cmp` traits.
