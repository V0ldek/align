/// ```rust
/// use align::alignment::{self, Alignment};
///
/// assert_eq!(1, alignment::One::size());
/// ```

///
/// Size is the size of a single page in the OS as returned by the
/// [`page_size`] crate.

/// ```rust
/// use page_size;
/// use align::alignment::{self, Alignment};
///
/// assert_eq!(page_size::get(), alignment::Page::size());
